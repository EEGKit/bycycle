    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the last tutorial notebook, I described the conventional approach for analyzing time-varying properties of neural oscillations, and in this notebook, we will go over our alternative approach. The fundamental goal of this approach is to characterize neural oscillations directly in the time domain. However, this is not straightforward because it attempts to extract the properties of the oscillatory component, despite the large amount of noise. Specifically, there are two very difficult problems:\n",
    "1. What are the features of the oscillation? How do they vary over time?\n",
    "2. During what times is the oscillation present?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle-by-cycle approach deploys a few strategies to approach these questions. As its name indicates, this algorithm segments the signal into individual cycles and then analyzes their features separately from one another. Normally, some preprocessing is recommended to aid in localizing peaks and troughs (eliminating high frequency power that mostly do not comprise the oscillator of interest). Additionally, a burst detection approach is applied to define the segments of the signal to be analyzed for their oscillatory properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process (as with all data analyses), it is important to be aware if the data is being processed appropriately. As signal processing is complicated, it is very beneficial to visualize the measured features along with the raw data to assure they make sense."
